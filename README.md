# Slides for my presentation + live coding session introducing Meteor + React, November 2016
By [Mark C Mitchell](http://www.markcmitchell.net), for students at Sydney Ultimo TAFE, November 2016.

Building off a talk I gave about Meteor in September 2015 for students at Sydney Ultimo TAFE, September 2015.

The live-demo session is a quick build of a message-board app in 30 minutes, which looks like this:

Live demo session is inspired by the work of Paul Dowman of OK GROW!, where he gave a talk about [building
a live chat app in 40 minutes with React and Meteor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcej5OboUVM).  


Some points in the Meteor section of the presentation modified from [zombiebaron](https://github.com/zlot/TechLancaster-Meteor-Talk)'s MeteorJS TechLancaster Talk.
